# Documentation Pipeline: Technical Specification

**Sample document demonstrating the complete docs-pipeline workflow: automated diagram generation, markdown processing, and professional PDF output.**

## Executive Summary

The docs-pipeline system provides an enterprise-grade documentation workflow that transforms Markdown sources into publication-quality PDFs with embedded architecture diagrams, syntax-highlighted code, and professional styling. This specification demonstrates the system's capabilities through automated generation of technical documentation.

## Architecture Components

### Pipeline Orchestrator

Coordinates multi-stage workflow execution using YAML configuration. The orchestrator loads configuration files, manages workspace execution, and coordinates between diagram generation and document conversion stages.

### Diagram Generator

Converts Structurizr DSL to multiple formats (Mermaid, PNG, SVG, PlantUML). Uses Docker-based Structurizr CLI for reliable, consistent diagram generation across platforms.

### PDF Generator

Uses Playwright for pixel-perfect rendering with Mermaid diagram optimization. Supports advanced features including:
- Code syntax highlighting
- Mathematical equations (KaTeX)
- Mermaid diagram embedding
- Custom styling profiles

### CLI Interface

Provides command-line access to all pipeline features:
- Single document conversion
- Full pipeline execution
- Dry-run mode for testing
- Parallel processing for batch operations

## Workflow

1. **Load Config** - Parse YAML configuration file
2. **Generate Diagrams** - Execute Structurizr export for each workspace
3. **Convert Documents** - Render PDFs with embedded diagrams
4. **Validate Output** - Ensure all artifacts generated successfully

**This entire document, including architecture diagrams and professional formatting, was generated by the pipeline in a single command.**

## Usage Example

```bash
# Generate everything
python -m tools.docs_pipeline.cli --config docs-pipeline.yaml

# With parallel processing
python -m tools.docs_pipeline.cli --config docs-pipeline.yaml --parallel

# Dry run to preview
python -m tools.docs_pipeline.cli --config docs-pipeline.yaml --dry-run
```

## Integration

The pipeline integrates seamlessly with:
- **CI/CD Systems** - Generate documentation in build pipelines
- **Web Interfaces** - Upload configs via web UI
- **Version Control** - Track DSL and Markdown changes together
- **Documentation Sites** - Publish generated PDFs automatically
