# Architecture Proposal Pipeline Configuration
# ============================================
# This pipeline transforms a rough draft architecture proposal
# into a polished, professional document ready for PDF generation.

# Notes:
# - Agents run in sequence, each building on the previous
# - Structure Analyzer identifies gaps (JSON output)
# - Content Enhancer expands and clarifies (Markdown output)
# - Technical Reviewer validates accuracy (JSON output)
# - Style Polisher ensures consistency (Markdown output)
# - Final output is ready for md2pdf pipeline
