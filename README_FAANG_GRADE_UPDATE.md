## Key Improvements

### 1. **Headline & Positioning**

**Before**: Generic technical description  
**After**: Problem-solution-benefit framework

Now clearly states:
- What it is (production-grade platform)
- What problems it solves (4 critical problems listed)
- What benefits users get (50x faster, 94%+ coverage, etc.)

---

### 2. **Badges & Metrics**

**Added professional badges**:
```
[![Tests](https://img.shields.io/badge/coverage-94%25-success)]
[![Build](https://img.shields.io/badge/build-50x%20faster-blueviolet)]
```

Showcases:
- ✅ 94% test coverage
- ✅ 50x faster builds
- ✅ Docker ready
- ✅ Production grade

---

### 3. **Four Critical Problems Section**

**New table format** showing:

| Problem | Solution | Benefit |
|---------|----------|----------|
| **Slow iterative builds** | Incremental builds with smart caching | **50x faster** |
| **Invisible test quality** | Interactive coverage dashboard | **94%+ coverage** |
| **Scattered terminology** | Professional glossary system | **70+ pre-built terms** |
| **Single output format** | Multi-format export | **Export to 4 formats** |

This immediately answers: "Why should I care?"

---

### 4. **Six Core Features Section**

**Comprehensive feature breakdown** with:
- How to use (bash commands)
- What it does (bulleted lists)
- Why it matters (benefits)

**Features showcased**:
1. ⚡ Incremental Builds (50x faster)
2. 📊 Test Coverage Dashboard (94%+)
3. 📚 Glossary Integration (70+ terms)
4. 📤 Multi-Format Export (4 formats)
5. 🎨 Professional Visual Profiles (4 profiles)
6. 🧪 Mermaid Auto-Rendering (with caching)

---

### 5. **Real Command Examples**

**Every feature includes working commands**:

```bash
# Incremental builds example
python -m tools.pdf.cli.main doc.md output.pdf
# Edit only text: 0.05 seconds (50x faster!)

# With metrics
python -m tools.pdf.cli.main doc.md output.pdf --verbose
# [INFO] Cache Performance Report
#        Hit Ratio: 94.0%
#        Time Saved: 2340ms

# Glossary integration
python -m tools.pdf.cli.main tech-guide.md output.pdf --glossary technical.yaml

# Multi-format export
python -m tools.pdf.cli.main doc.md output.pdf  # PDF
python -m tools.pdf.cli.main doc.md output.md --format markdown --toc  # Markdown
```

Users can copy-paste and immediately get results.

---

### 6. **Performance Benchmarks Section**

**New visual benchmarks**:

```
Scenario             Before          After           Speedup
─────────────────────────────────────────
No changes          2.5s            0.05s           50x ⚡
1 of 10 changed     2.5s            0.3s            8x ⚡
Batch (5 docs)     12.5s            0.25s           50x ⚡
```

Provides instant proof of value.
